# 🎰 Pocket Rehab: Toxic Shock - Complete Game Guide

## 🎮 Game Overview

**Genre:** High Volatility Cluster Slot
**Grid:** 6 Reels × 5 Rows
**Max Win:** 50,000x Bet
**RTP:** High Volatility

---

## 📋 How to Win (Base Game)

### Pay Anywhere System
Unlike traditional slots, this game uses **"Pay Anywhere"** mechanics:

- **Match 8+:** You need 8 or more of the same symbol anywhere on the screen to trigger a win
- They don't need to touch or form lines
- **Cascading Drops:** After wins, new symbols fall from the top to fill empty spaces

---

## 💉 The Overdose Cycle (Unique Mechanic)

This is the heart of the game. Winning symbols don't just disappear - they transform!

### Stage 1: INFECTION 🦠
- When symbols win, they **stick to the screen**
- Get a **green "Glitch" overlay**
- Symbol turns green and pulsates

### Stage 2: MUTATION 🧪
- If those sticky symbols are part of a **new win** on the next drop
- They **turn into WILDS** (Neon Puke)
- Yellow glow and pulsing effect

### Stage 3: THE CRASH 💥
- If the Wilds are part of a win, they **finally explode**
- Leave behind a **Multiplier (x2)** on that grid spot
- Future wins on that spot are **doubled**
- Multipliers stack: x2 → x4 → x8 → x16...

## 🎨 The Symbols

### High Pay Symbols (The Addicts)
- **🐀 Sparky (The Rat)** - 1.0x per symbol

## 🎯 Strategy Tips

### Base Game
1. **Build Multipliers Early:** Focus on getting infected symbols in the same spots
2. **Watch for Clusters:** The more symbols in a cluster, the better the cascade potential
3. **Scatters are Gold:** 3+ scatters trigger massive bonus potential

### Free Spins (Detox Ward)
1. **Avoid The Doctor:** If you see the needle symbol land, your multipliers reset!
2. **Stack Multipliers:** Try to get wins in the same grid positions repeatedly
3. **Be Patient:** The first few spins build the multipliers, big wins come at the end

### Bonus Buy
- **Conservative:** Buy "Catch 'Em" at 100x for medium volatility
- **Balanced:** Buy "Beatdown" at 200x for guaranteed action
- **All In:** Buy "Detox Ward" at 500x only when you have a solid bankroll
